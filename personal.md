I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to parents Michael Palmer Ruddy and Ana Mar√≠a Ruddy Romaguera. I lived in Gurabo before moving to Union City in northwestern Tennessee. I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina for graduate school. My academic career had me living in many places
* Rhode Island, RI
* Leipzig, Germany
* Minneapolis, MN
* San Rafael, Bay Area, CA
I currently live in San Rafael, but will be relocated to Kitchener-Waterloo in July. I enjoy bouldering at my local rock climbing gym, as well as at gyms I encounter during my travels. My other hobbies include gardening, cooking, reading, and hiking.
