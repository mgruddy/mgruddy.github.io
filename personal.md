## Bio

I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to parents Michael Palmer Ruddy and Ana Mar√≠a Ruddy Romaguera. I lived in Gurabo before moving to Union City in northwestern Tennessee. I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina for graduate school. During my academic career I lived in many places:
* Rhode Island, RI
* Leipzig, Germany
* Minneapolis, MN
* San Rafael, Bay Area, CA

## Hobbies

I enjoy bouldering at my local rock climbing gym, as well as at gyms I encounter during my travels. My other hobbies include gardening, cooking, reading, and hiking.

## Other Interests

I became interested in the applications of geometry and statistics to the political redistricting process after attending the [Gerrymandering Workshop at Duke](https://sites.duke.edu/gerrymandering/) hosted by [Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group](https://mggg.org) and the [Quantifying Gerrymandering Group at Duke](https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/) in 2017. In 2021 I gave two talks for different chapters (Saxony and Frankfurt) of Democrats Abroad in Germany on the interaction between geometry and redistricting and the political implications. I am happy to provide the slides upon request or discuss lecturing on this topic for any group wishing to understand the impact of redistricting.
