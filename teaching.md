## Mathematics Courses

During graduate school I taught a number of Calculus I and II courses with different variations (Honors, Life Sciences, etc.) as well as a course on Euclidean Geometry. You can find a Teaching Portfolio that I prepared during Summer 2019 <a href="folder/portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> which provides a detailed description of those courses as well as my philosophy on how I approached teaching those courses.

## Data Science Courses

For the MS in Data Science Program at the University of San Francisco I taught the following courses:
* Introduction to Deep Learning in PyTorch, Summer 2021, [course materials](https://github.com/mgruddy/DeepLearning_MSDS21)
* Communications for Analytics, Fall 2021

Additionally I was instructor for two other data science courses at USF:
* Introduction to Data Science in R, Spring 2021, [course materials](https://github.com/mgruddy/Intro_Data_ScienceR_Spring2021)
* Introduction to Statistical Modeling in Python, Spring 2022, [course materials](https://github.com/mgruddy/StatModeling_MSDS22)
