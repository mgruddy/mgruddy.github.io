## Data Science Courses

For the MS in Data Science Program at the University of San Francisco I taught the following courses:
* Introduction to Deep Learning in PyTorch, Summer 2021, [course materials](https://github.com/mgruddy/DeepLearning_MSDS21)
* Communications for Analytics, Fall 2021

Additionally I was instructor for two other data science courses at USF:
* Introduction to Data Science in R, Spring 2021, [course materials](https://github.com/mgruddy/Intro_Data_ScienceR_Spring2021)
* Introduction to Statistical Modeling in Python, Spring 2022, [course materials](https://github.com/mgruddy/StatModeling_MSDS22)

## Mathematics Courses

During graduate school I taught a number of Calculus I and II courses with different variations (Honors, Life Sciences, etc.) as well as a course on Euclidean Geometry. You can find a Teaching Portfolio that I prepared during Summer 2019 <a href="folder/portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> which provides a detailed description of those courses as well as my philosophy on how I approached teaching those courses.

## Past Activities

In 2017 I attended a workshop on [inquiry-based learning](http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org) at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo which heavily influenced my teaching (and learning!) philosophy. During the academic year 2018-2019 I participated in the [GeT (Geometry for Teachers) project](https://www.gripumich.org/projects/get-support/) as an instructor who had taught a university geometry course required by aspiring high school mathematics teachers. I learned about the challenges faced by high school mathematics teachers, the push to remove geometry from high school, and how instructors of GeT courses could help.
