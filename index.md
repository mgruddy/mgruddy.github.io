## About

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [Qventus](https://qventus.com) working on using machine learning to develop models to improve hospital and health system operations. I received my PhD in Mathematics from North Carolina State University under the supervision of [Dr. Irina Kogan](https://iakogan.math.ncsu.edu) and [Dr. Cynthia Vinzant](http://sites.math.washington.edu/~vinzant/). My research in mathematics is largely concerned with geometric invariants and their computation. I became interested in data science through the field of computer vision, but have since gained experience and interest in NLP and tabular data algorithms as well. Before my current position with Qventus I had the pleasure of being a part of the following groups:
* Assistant Professor in the [MS in Data Science Program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science) at University of San Francisco
* Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Nonlinear Algebra group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/research.html), Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences
